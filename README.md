### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

While completing this project my major learning was to customize the bullets color in an unordered list using the pseudo-element ::before and numbers in an ordered list using the pseudo-element ::marker

### Continued development

In future projects I would lay emphasis on the responsive design, given that I do have trouble with it.
